For that reason we contacted the head of diagnostic laboratory of infectious diseases Jolanta Žiliukienė.</p><h3>Contribution</h3><p>The specialist informed about the statistics of amebiasis in Lithuania and the currently used method of its detection – microscopal stool analysis. She pointed out that rapid diagnostic tests for this infection would be beneficial not only in the endemic countries but also in Lithuania. Such a tool would facilitate diagnostic laboratories specialists' work. Žiliukienė also mentioned the lack of medications in our country as one of the obstacles associated with amebiasis.</p><h3>Adjustments</h3><p>After the meeting, we understood that there is no need to create quantitave test for amebiasis. It would be enough to simply detect Entamoeba histolytica.</p><h3>Our next steps (punktai)</h3><p>We will create qualitative test for amebiasis invasive form detection.</p>"

In lab group, previously  we have not planned how we are going to get  ssDNA from the dsDNA poll after PCR steps, measure sequences poll enrichment with the highest affinity aptamers, regulate the reaction stringency, measure the affinity of the selected aptamer to recombinant Entemoeba histolytica protein.Professor advised to search for alternative methods for some SELEX steps in case soething would go wrong or we would be runing out of time.

In addition, the professor encouraged us to search for alternative colorimetric signal generating techniques that would be used in the detection test. Secondly, the professor has seen many uncertainties in the therapeutic part. The most compromising question - would chosen flavonoids and resveratrol be suitable for real-life usage because of their extensive reactivity and tendency to act as the main inhibitors of some medicine when consumed in higher doses. </p><h3>Adjustments</h3><p>During the meeting, we have came to the aggrement to use surface plasmon resonance method in order to evaluate the level of aptamers affinity to Eh proteins. Furthermore, we have decided to analyze more deeply the requirements of synthesis of polythiophene which had been chosen as a suitable dye for detection kit.  Moreover, we have raised some questions about the needed efficiency of the synthesis of the therapeutic compounds and the probable probiotics’ density in the gut.</p><h3>Our next steps (punktai)</h3><p>We have commited ourselves to make a deeper research of some variants of SELEX steps, raise considerations about PT dye and anticoagulant interactions, analyze subtleties of PT dye synthesis and search for the most suitable negative controls for SELEX.

Snarskis’ tips, we will adjust our molecular dynamics flow to make our simulations more accurate, real-like fusion protein structures. </p><h3>Our next steps (punktai)</h3><p>We will define the main purpose of molecular dynamics simulation, adjust commands and .mdp files, and request computational resources in the Life Sciences Center.</p>"

Therefore getting to know the experiences, challenges in clinical practice was our priority from the beginning of the project, as we aim to bring advance to clinical practice as well. Audrone Marcinkute presented several cases from her clinical practice, emphasising on their diagnostic part and symptomatics, provided feedback to our solutions.</p><h3>Contribution</h3><p>Audrone Marcinkute pointed out that since year 2007, the difference in proportion between intestinal and extraintestinal amoebiasis is increasing due to extraintestinal cases. This means that intestinal amoebiasis passes unnoticibaly / undetected. The test would be extremely beneificial, and applicable. However, detection for intestinal form would be also invaluable, because the earlier disease is identified, the better is the treatment. People should be keen on consuming our probiotics as their active substance is naturally occuring in plants. Input for our educational part: emphasis on clean water and water removal from food products</p><h3>Adjustments</h3><p>We got excited and motivated as relevance of our project was confirmed. Further development for detection of intestinal amoebiasis is needed, however we do not have enought time left. We need to adjust our communication about amoebiasis by putting more emphasis on its transmission through water. Communication about probiotics should be emphasised on its natural origin in order to be more appealing for targeted customers.</p><h3>Our next steps (punktai)</h3><p>We agreed to keep in touch as there where several questions raised that nor we, nor A. Marcinkute had no answer. A. Marcinkute offered to consult with other colleagues regarding the questions.  We edited primary option of our educational poster for regions with the highest prevalence.</p>"
