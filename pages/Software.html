            <h3 class="index-headline">EFBALite</h3>
              <h4>Motivation</h4>
              <p>
                Creating aptamers in the labaratory is an expensive and time consuming process. Thus we
                were inspired by <b>[1]</b> to create software that would help with this process.
                The result of our efforts is EFBALite - an implementation
                (with several improvments and additions) of the Entropic Fragment-Based Approach ...
                in the Python programming language that is able to generate an aptamer from scratch.
              </p>
              <p>
                The program and user guide is available at the GitHub repository (...).
              </p>
              <h4>Description and theory</h4>
              <p>
                As the name suggest the algorithm used by EFBALite is based on
                a statistical measure called relative entropy (or Kullback–Leibler divergence),
                thus to begin we need to construct a probability space. We use statistical mechanics to accomplish this goal.
              </p>
              <p>
                Let \(\Omega\) denote the phase space of our aptamer target complex.
                The PDF (point density function) of \(\Omega\) (considered as a random variable) is given by
                $$f_{\Omega} (Q) = \frac{e^{-\beta H(Q)}}{Z},$$
                where \(H\) is the Hamiltonian, \(\beta\) is a constant (which depends on temperature) and 
                $$Z = \int_{\mathbb{R} ^ n} e^{-\beta H(Q)} dQ$$
                is the partition function.
              </p>
              <p>
                We approach the problem of finding a suitable aptamer for our target using a
                "lockpicking" approach. That is we try to generate the aptamer one nucleotide at the time,
                instead of trying to guess the whole sequence at once.
                This approach allows us to avoid a combinatorial explosion for longer sequences.
              </p>
              <p>
                Suppose we are trying to fit an aptamer of length one (that is a single nucleotide)
                to our target. The goal of our approach is to find a nucloetide that binds the best when
                compared to the binding of a random nucleotide. In our approach we measure this by seeing
                how random the distribution of \(\Omega\) is with a specific nucleotide instead of a random one.
                Alternatively, we can formulate this as "how much information 
                do we gain about \(\Omega\) if we use this specific nucleotide instead of a random one?".
                We then of course pick the nucleotide with the biggest information gain. 
              </p>
              <p>
                The information gain can be quantified as relative entropy. But first, more notation,
                let \(\Omega^R\) denote the phase phase of the complex with a random nucleotide and \(\Omega^N\) the
                phase phase of the complex with a particular nucleotide, where \(N\) can be equal to A, C, G, T or U
                (depending on your flavor of aptamer). Then the relative entropy \(D_{KL}\) from
                \(\Omega^R\) to \(\Omega^N\) is equal to
                $$D_{KL} = \int_{\mathbb{R}^n} f_{\Omega^N}(Q) \log\left(\frac{f_{\Omega^N}(Q)}{f_{\Omega^R}(Q)}\right) dQ,$$
                note that \(D_{KL}\) is not symmetric in terms of \(\Omega^R\) and \(\Omega^N\).
              </p>
              <p>
                The \(f_{\Omega^R}(Q)\) can be calculated as
                $$ f_{\Omega^R}(Q) = \sum_{n} P(N = n)f_{\Omega^n}(Q).$$
                We took \(P(N = n)\) to be equal to \(1/4\), but alternative weights can
                be used if one knows the prior distribution of nucleotides in the aptamer.
              </p>
              <p>
                We find the subsequent nucleotides in the aptamer by fixing the sequence that we have already
                found and then computing the relative entropies for the next nucleotide.
              </p>
              <p>
                For the practical implementation of the algorithm we construct a discrete phase space. For the first
                nucleotide, we sample points on the surface of the target which are approximately \(x\)
                angstroms apart (\(x\) can be specified as desired) and additionally
                we rotate the nucleotide by 0 and 180 degrees along all Euler angles,
                where we consider the O3 atom of the nucleotide to be the zero point of the Euclidean space.
                For the subsequent nucleotides, we keep the already determined sequence fixed in space
                and rotate the next nucleotide by -90, -60, -30, 0, 30, 60 and 90 degrees along all Euler angles
                by considering the phosphate atom as the zero point of the Euclidean space.
              </p>
              <p>
                The "lockpicking" approach does not find the optimal sequence in the space of
                all sequences in terms of information gain. To get as close to the global maximum we implement
                a searching procedure by specifying an information gain threshold \(T\) which each nucleotide in
                the sequence must reach. This goes as follows. For the first nucleotide take the one with
                the highest relative entropy, fix it to the phase space position that is most probable.
                Now compute the second nucleotide, if the maximum relative entropy is higher than \(T\) keep the nucleotide,
                fix it to the most probable position and continue, if not backtrack to the first
                nucleotide and check the second most probable position. Continue this until you find a sequence
                of desired length or exhaust all possible sampling positions.
              </p>
              <h4>Implementation</h4>
              <p>
                The program is written using the Python programming language.
              </p>
              <p>
                To compute the energy of the aptamer target complex we use the
                OpenMM package and use the OpenMM's implementation of the AMBER14 forcefield.
              </p>
              <p>
                The program finishes generating an aptamer in reasonable time (overnight) on
                a personal computer with a GPU.
              </p>
              <h4>Validation</h4>
              <p>[Laukiam Delfto!!!]</p>
            <h3 class="index-headline">EFBAScore</h3>
              <h4>Motivation</h4>
              <p>
                The Entropic-Fragment Based approach can be used to create a a function that would score
                the aptamer's affinity to target molecule. We implemented this scoring function in our second program -
                EFBAScore. Admittedly, this scoring function is not very accurate, however
                the main benefit is that it can be used to perform bulk scoring (that is score many
                sequences with high computational efficiency) which allowed us to generate the starting dataset for
                [Sauliaus softo pavadinimas] - our third piece of software.
              </p>
              <p>
                The program and user guide is available at the GitHub repository (...).
              </p>
              <h4>Description and theory</h4>
              <p>
                The main ideas are the same as EFBALite. However, now we have an input sequence and
                do not have to compare entropies between different nucleotides. Thus, our final score
                is just the sum of entropies computed at every step.
              </p>
              <p>
                To pick the spatial position for the
                nucleotide we use the position that has the highest probability and. In order to
                compute the entropy of a nucleotide we use a uniformly distributed random variable 
                compute the relative entropy at every step instead of \(\Omega^R\).
              </p>
              <h4>Implementation</h4>
              <p>
                The program is written using the Python programming language.
              </p>
              <p>

                and use the OpenMM's implementation of the AMBER14 forcefield.
