           Introduction
          </h3>
          <p>
           This year our team was lucky to communicate with numerous iGEM teams from all over the world. Some of the interactions were initiated by us and some - by other teams. Our list of collaborations is in an especially broad spectrum of topics: integrated human practices on amebiasis, education, and communication.

           We got in touch with the

           team regarding their request for collaboration. We had already chosen target regions, of which one was India. We asked for contacts of professionals that are working with the disease in a laboratory or clinical setting. As a result, iISER Tirupati kindly sent us a full excel sheet with various contacts we used later on.

           and our team both analyzed human infectious diseases that are more common in developing regions. Thus, we organized a call to get to know each other better and decided on further collaborations. Afterward, we exchanged contact information of specialists from relevant areas in our countries.
          </p>
          <p>
           We also have participated in the IISER Berhampur podcast series “

           ” and shared our perspectives on synthetic biology, “AmeBye”, and our team.              Lastly, the IISER Berhampur team offered help on our educational poster about amebiasis. Team members proofread it, translated it into their native languages, and shared the poster on social media.

At first, we got to know each other better, gained new insight into our human practices activities, and agreed on collaboration. The team connected us with Dr. María del Socorro Flores González, Professor at Instituto de Biotecnología, Facultad de Ciencias Biológicas, UANL. We gained invaluable insights on the wet lab processes, that can be found on
