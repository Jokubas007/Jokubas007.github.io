           Getting acquainted
          </h3>
          <p>
           In June, we found on Slack that our and TU Delft teams are working               with aptamers this year. Therefore we decided to arrange a meeting               to brainstorm how our teams could work together. We had our first               online call on the 2nd of July. After this meeting, we decided to               orientate our partnership in the
           <b>
            dry lab
           </b>
           .
          </p>
          <p>
           At the time our dry lab team was in the
           <b>
            design stage
           </b>
           of the                 software development. One of the ideas was to run M.A.W.S. (making                 aptamers without SELEX), program originally created by Heidelberg                 iGEM 2015 team[1], update and potentially improve it. Apparently,                 TU Delft team was also interested in running this program. Since                 our teams found mutual interest, our dry lab team set ourselves                 the task to
           <b>
            plan
           </b>
           the potential collaboration regarding this                   idea. In general, we initially suggested that our teams                 would
           <b>
            collaborate
           </b>
           on improving the program.
          </p>

           Collaboration brainstorming
          </h3>
          <p>
           However, our initially suggested plan to focus on the software               was not suitable for the timetable of TU Delft’s dry lab team.               Due to this reason, we looked for other mutual spots to collaborate.               Since our projects include sequencing and data analysis, we came               up with an idea to apply each other’s chosen sequencing workflows               and compare the results. Our teams organized another meeting to
           <b>
            consider this idea
           </b>
           and get a better insight into our               sequencing analysis workflows. After the meeting we decided               that we cannot apply each other’s analysis, thus we
           <b>
            rejected
           </b>
           this conception.
          </p>
          <h3 class="index-headline">
           Designing the partnership
          </h3>
          <p>
           Both meetings that we organized were indeed enjoyable and               fruitful, hence we were interested in continuing our cooperation.               Since we had several interactions, we thought that our communication               might grow into a
           <b>
            partnership
           </b>
           . Apparently, both we and TU               Delft team were interested in fulfilling the Gold criteria regarding               this subject.
          </p>
          <p>
           In the end of July, we had
           <b>
            one complete engineering cycle
           </b>
           ,               regarding software,
           <b>
            passed
           </b>
           : we designed the implementation of               the program, the implementation was performed, and first results               (aptamer sequences for our target protein EhPPDK) were validated using               aptamer affinity evaluation
           <i>
            in silico
           </i>
           modeling flow. The results               of docking showed that our software generates aptamers of length N that               are more affine than random aptamers of the same length N.

          <p>
           We contacted TU Delft with the question regarding the potential partnership               when we were at the point of the completed second “Build” stage. Our dry               lab team was looking for ways to enter the
           <b>
            testing
           </b>
           stage -
           <b>
            validating
           </b>
           the software. Meanwhile, TU Delft team was interested               in getting an aptamer sequence for their vitamin detection using an
           <b>
            alternative
           </b>
           approach more
           <b>
            optimized
           </b>
           than DRIVER. Finally,               we found a
           <b>
            mutual spot
           </b>
           for a meaningful partnership where both               teams would
           <b>
            benefit.
           </b>
          </p>
          <p>
           In order to plan our partnership, we organized another call, in which we               discussed the details about aptamer generation.
          </p>
          <h3 class="index-headline">
           Cooperation
          </h3>
          <p>
           At first, TU Delft team requested to generate aptamers for vitamins B9,               B12, and B1. Although even after introducing adjustments to the program               to take vitamin molecules as input, the program
           <b>
            did not generate
           </b>
           affine aptamer sequences for the mentioned vitamins. Unexpectedly, this               brought our software development through testing and learning stages.               After designing, building and testing several methods to tackle the               problem, we
           <b>
            learned
           </b>
           that our software has the
           <b>
            limitation
           </b>
           to take only protein molecules as targets.
          </p>
          <p>
           Eventually, we decided to address the issue of the small targets by               arranging another call. We explained that the program works properly               only for protein targets, and we asked whether, by chance, there would               be a
           <b>
            protein structure
           </b>
           for which they would require an aptamer               sequence. TU Delft team decided to devote some time for a literature               analysis about proteins related to vitamins, and eventually, they               reached out to us with positive news. They announced that they found               a
           <b>
            retinol-binding protein (RBP4)
           </b>
           that binds to vitamin A,               which they would be interested in detecting using aptamers. By               including this protein, they would
           <b>
            expand their project
           </b>
           ,               and we could
           <b>
            validate our software
           </b>
           .
          </p>
          <p>
           We settled down with the protein, and in a couple of days, we prepared               single-stranded DNA aptamer sequences 21 and 30 nucleotides long, scored               them using aptamer docking flow, and sent them to our colleagues from               the Netherlands. The scores of the sequences are given in table 1. Mfold               score stands for evaluation of aptamer’s stability of its secondary               structure in regards to Gibbs energy. Meanwhile HDOCK score is a score               of docking which stands for aptamer’s affinity to the target. Both of               these scores are considered the smaller the better.

           After several days, TU Delft team wrote us a letter inviting us to               have a call before setting up an order. Eventually, to keep the               expenses reasonable,, we adjusted the agreement for the partnership               that they would order
           <b>
            three
           </b>
           sequences:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            The first sequence would be
            <b>
             DNA
            </b>
            (30 nucleotides long) aptamer for our software
            <b>
             validation.
            </b>
           </li>
           <li>
            The second sequence would be an
            <b>
             RNA
            </b>
            (30 nucleotides long) aptamer on its own                 to
            <b>
             validate
            </b>
            how our software predicts affine RNA aptamers.
           </li>
           <li>
            Additionally, they would order the same RNA sequence incorporated into the
            <b>
             ribozyme
            </b>
            that would be the TU Delft project’s
            <b>
             extension
            </b>
            .
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           This agreement briefly brought our software development to the building stage,               in which we adjusted the program to make RNA aptamers as well. After evaluation               of the aptamers
           <i>
            in silico
           </i>
           we sent the additional sequences for our               colleagues from TU Delft.
