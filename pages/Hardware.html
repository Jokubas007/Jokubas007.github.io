                Background
             </h3>
             <p>
                Our diagnostic test is based on samples from blood and for this reason we created a vertical flow diagnostic test hardware design. Currently available models did not suit our needs as they were particularly created for lateral flow methods. Additionally, included buffers dilute the sample too much and create lower molarity solutions for our biomarkers. The problem occurs for lower dissociation constant aptamers - less molecules per volume mean less association and reduced colorimetric response.
    
             </p>
             <h3 class="index-headline">
                Introduction
             </h3>
             <p>
                To make our diagnostic test reproducible we created a 3D printed case with 3 different spots for analyses. One spot for our biomarker and two control spots.  Upscaling manufacturing quantity to meet cost efficient level is possible by recreating model for injection molding, which is relatively cheaper for people in developing countries. Few other design considerations for cost cutting were applied and will be demonstrated later on.
             </p>
             <p>
    For inspiration we took a lateral flow assay (LFA) device and thought about negative aspects which create <b>false negative</b> or <b>false positive</b> results and how we could solve them. During examination we found out that one of the main reasons for such results are physics behind colored bands from gold nanoparticles. Optimum pH should be kept during the whole detection period or wrong interpretation of the results is inevitable. In particular false negatives are more of a problem than false positives. The same example can be found in SARS-CoV-2 rapid tests where false negatives are 20% higher than for RT‐PCR [1]. 
             </p>
             <p>
    False negative results mean missed cases of infection, with either delayed or no confirmed diagnosis and increased risk of community transmission due to false sense of security. In amebiasis circumstances postponed treatment could mean serious health problems or even fatality. For these reasons vertical flow colorimetric response was chosen as one of the possible solutions.

             <p>
                After researching we chose to create a model ourselves and the first version was for determining internal dimensions which should hold all necessary membranes. The first trial is shown in Figure 1. 
             </p>

    We determined that oval shapes for membranes are best suited as they hold everything in place neatly. Both layers are embedded from top and bottom by plastic pieces and there are no need for glue. 
    By building and learning from model about holes’ dimensions we created another model for further usage shown in figures 3 and 4.

    Version 2 showed negative results for user experience as it was too small to hold in hands. Also, hole depth was another problem as it could hold more blood but on the other hand it meant that person would have to precisely hit the membrane. We rethinked what from both previous models add value and created the final third design.

    The last one model passed initial user experience tests and we included it in our proof of concept measurements. Overall model volume is X cubic centimeters. We think it is bare minimum for making it strong enough by using less materials. Original material in 3D printing was polylactic acid (PLA) as it was cost efficient for testing our design.

             <p>
    For better transportation and safer usage each spot could have a glued clear plastic bottom. It could also have positive effect for longevity of aptamers and prevent from environmental impact. 
             </p>
             <p>
    Also, PVDF membrane could be changed to another more suitable for specific biomarker. It is known that proteins bind to membrane materials. To interfere with that interaction many other types of membranes could be applicable. Nitrocellulose is another option which we did not try in our case.
